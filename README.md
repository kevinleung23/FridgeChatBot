# FridgeChatBot

Microsoft Bot Framework (C#) to help keep track of ingredients and find recipes.

Technical Evangelist Kevin Leung @KSLHacks

Bot that helps you make decisions on what to cook for your next meal. The bot takes ingredients that you have at home, or would like to cook with and offers recipes with ratings, links and pictures. Once you decide on a recipe, it can send you a grocery list so you know exactly what to buy! This bot can even retain the state of your grocery list.
